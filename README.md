# Menuhub - a multi-tenant system
-	Developed the user interfaces for branches, customers, staff, staff roles, items and other base entities
-	Developed payment and billing management components that enabled online payment processing
-	Implemented login and authentication in the front end with React on JSON web tokens
-	Interfaced with EFTPOS and receipt printers on Payment Express

Because of the copyright issues, I just upload some piece of code.

Here is a short video to have a look at the project, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq7fWlg4VXU
